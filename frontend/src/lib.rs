//! Shared Dioxus components for `omnibus` (web) and `omnibus-mobile` (native).

//! Platform-specific behavior (nav variant, data-fetching transport) is
//! gated behind the `web` and `mobile` features. Components themselves stay
//! platform-agnostic — they use `use_signal` + `use_resource`, and a thin
//! data layer adapts to each transport.
